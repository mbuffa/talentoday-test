# Teleporter test

It's the 30th century. You're a freshly recruited engineer in a famous space company and you've inherited a work-in-progress project.

This is a basic storage system for registering reservations for travelling through teleporters. SQL and NoSQL are so vintage, we're building it in pure Ruby.

You're expected to make rspecs failures go green, and doing it so that your work will be as much readable, reusable, and smart as possible.

Do not mind parts not covered by rspecs, such as Reservation#departure_time. However, you may add as much rspecs as you see fit, do some refactoring, clean some existing code or take down TODO entries.

Good luck.
